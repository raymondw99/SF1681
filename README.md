# SF1681 Linear Algebra, Advanced course
Image compresser using singular value decomposition. Minor project in the course.
The image is saves as a MATLAB matrix. The algorithm plots the singular values as well as the images for 
different ranks of singular values.

Either import the image file or insert the image compression code in the image file for correct output.
